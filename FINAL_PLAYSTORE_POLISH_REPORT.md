# ScanMate AI Pro — Final Play Store Polish Report

## Brand/package status

- App name standardized as **ScanMate AI Pro**.
- Branding cleaned to use only the app name and package identifier.
- Package / namespace migrated from old placeholder identifiers to:
  - `com.synthbyte.scanmate`
- Updated:
  - Gradle `namespace`
  - Gradle `applicationId`
  - Kotlin package declarations
  - Kotlin imports
  - test package declarations
  - ProGuard keep rules
  - manifest component references through namespace-relative names
  - metadata and README branding

## Bugs / review issues fixed

- Removed remaining placeholder package/application ID references.
- Renamed placeholder test class names to ScanMate-specific test names.
- Preserved FileProvider authority as `${applicationId}.fileprovider`, so it now resolves to `com.synthbyte.scanmate.fileprovider` and remains variant-safe for debug builds.
- Kept Gradle wrapper fallback valid; wrapper is no longer a corrupt JAR, but it still requires network/local Gradle to download/run Gradle 8.9 outside CI.
- GitHub Actions remains protected by installing clean Gradle 8.9 directly.
- XML resources were parsed successfully after the polish changes.
- Kotlin source brace-balance scan passed across 41 Kotlin source files.

## UX improvements implemented

### Onboarding

Added a first-launch onboarding flow with:

1. Document scanning
2. English OCR
3. Optional AI tools
4. Secure vault
5. PDF/QR/export tools

The onboarding completion state is stored in DataStore and can be skipped or completed with a Get Started button.

### Home/Documents polish

- Added document thumbnail support using Coil from first scanned/imported page.
- Added visible document metadata:
  - workspace
  - category
  - scan date
  - page count
  - estimated file size
  - OCR word count
  - simple quality label
- Added richer filtering:
  - All
  - Favorites
  - Pinned
  - Recent
  - OCR
  - PDF
- Added sorting:
  - Newest
  - Oldest
  - Name A-Z
  - Largest
  - Most pages
- Added multi-select mode with safe bulk actions:
  - favorite selected
  - pin selected
  - move selected to Inbox
  - export selected page files as ZIP
  - delete selected with confirmation

### Vault polish

Added a real Secure Vault browser screen:

- lists `.vault` files from app-managed vault storage
- decrypt preview through existing Android Keystore AES-GCM utility
- share decrypted text when explicitly requested
- share encrypted vault file
- delete vault item with confirmation
- empty state and error-safe preview behavior

### Settings polish

- Added default workspace setting in DataStore.
- New scans/imports can use the saved default workspace.
- Gemini model selector remains visible and explicit.
- API key behavior remains user-key only; no hardcoded key added.

### Camera workflow polish

- Preserved existing flash toggle and batch scan counter.
- New scanned documents now honor the default workspace setting.
- Existing CameraX safety/fallback handling is preserved.

## Play Store readiness fixes

- Removed company branding from metadata and README.
- Updated version default to `1.5.0` / versionCode 5.
- Added branded string resources:
  - `app_name`
  - `play_store_summary`
- Added monochrome launcher icon vector and wired adaptive icons to it.
- Added splash-screen style attributes for a more polished launch identity.
- Updated backup/data-extraction XML to exclude Vault folders from cloud backup/device transfer paths.
- R8/ProGuard rules remain safe with minification disabled for production QA.

- `README.md`
- `metadata.json`
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `app/src/main/java/com/synthbyte/scanmate/MainActivity.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/synthbyte/scanmate/data/SettingsRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/synthbyte/scanmate/data/DocDao.kt`

- `app/src/main/res/xml/backup_rules.xml`
- `app/src/main/res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`
- renamed local/instrumented test files to ScanMate-specific names

## Build status in sandbox

A full Gradle build was **not possible inside this sandbox** because internet/DNS access is disabled and no system Gradle installation is available.

Verified locally in sandbox:

- ZIP/project extraction succeeded.
- Gradle wrapper JAR is structurally valid and launches.
- Wrapper fails only when attempting to download Gradle from `services.gradle.org`, which is expected in this offline sandbox.
- Android XML resources parse successfully.
- Kotlin brace-balance check passed across 41 source files.
- Package/reference migration scan found no remaining placeholder package, old placeholder applicationId, or placeholder theme app-source references.

## GitHub Actions status

The workflow `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` is preserved and still builds/uploads:

- Debug APK
- Release APK
- Release AAB

The workflow installs clean Gradle 8.9 in CI and does not require signing secrets for unsigned release build artifacts.

## Intentionally not added

Per project rules, this phase did **not** add:

- cloud sync
- login/auth
- paid subscriptions
- hardcoded API keys
- multi-language OCR
- risky auto-capture edge detection
- backend systems

## Remaining risks / real-device testing needs

These require real Android device or GitHub Actions verification:

- Full Gradle compile/build after package migration
- CameraX behavior across low-end Android 9–16 devices
- ML Kit English OCR runtime behavior
- QR scanning camera behavior
- Widget rendering/click behavior on different launchers
- PDF/DOCX/TXT/ZIP export from large documents
- Vault encryption/decryption after app reinstall/device restore
- Performance of large thumbnail lists on low-RAM devices

## Honest implementation note

Swipe-to-delete gestures were not implemented in this final pass because the safer Play Store-readiness choice was to add confirmation-based multi-select destructive actions rather than introduce a potentially unstable gesture API without Gradle/device verification. Bulk actions are implemented through a safer explicit select mode.
